## Prerequisites
- JDK 8
  - JavaFX must be installed in the home directory of the JDK.
    - If you're running Ubuntu OpenJDK, you'll have to do an [extra step](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/34243982/why-is-javafx-is-not-included-in-openjdk-8-on-ubuntu-wily-15-10):
      `sudo apt-get install openjfx`
- [Eta](https://github.com/typelead/eta) (On `master` branch)

## Running
```
$ cd eta-2048
$ etlas install --dependencies-only # First-time only
$ etlas run
```

## Changes from Original
Gloss is replaced by manual FFI bindings to JavaFX that simulates just enough of the Gloss API to port this project. The upper bounds were also updated to account for the changes since the original program was written.
